In addition to the basic search and data storage functions, we implement an online game “How many movies can you name from one backdrop image?”  The game is a timing trivia. \r\nUser could guess the title of movie from an image. Every correct answer can gain 10 points and 5 extra seconds. If you know movies well, this could be an endless journey. After the game is finished, user could compare the result with past top records and tweet the result.\r\n\r\nMODULES AND ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nThe project consists of online databases and website. The databases store data of movies, users, actors…etc with mySQL management system. The website is a typical “html+css+javascript” structure. The front-end part is written with Jade engine. The back-end part is written with Node.js and is linked with the database. We have three main directories: “views/public/routes” containing “.jade/ .css/ .js” files. The APIs and other web functions are implemented based on these architectures and structures.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATION\r\n\r\n  Database : mySQL and MongoDB;\r\n  Web development : Node.js + Jade engine + CSS;\r\n  API : Bing Search API + Twitter API\r\n\r\nInstructions to run:\r\nRun app.js as a node application.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
